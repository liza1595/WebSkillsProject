    <br/>
    <p>Graphic Design comes in many different shapes and forms. Some people specialize in advertising, some in logos, and other just in general art.<br/>
        A common tools in graphic design are from the Adobe Suite, such as illustrator, photoshop, and after effects.<br/> Typically for someone to get better at the skill, one has to master those programs or something similar to them.<br/>
        In my journey of the skill, I initially just drew on paper for fun.<br/> While being in college, I have taken multiple graphic classes including animation, digital design, and computer graphics. <br/>
        Those classes have taught me basic artistic skills and the programs within the Adobe Suite. <br/>Those classes along with personal and professional projects have slowly been building my graphic design skills </p>
